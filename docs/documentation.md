# Documentation
The purpose of documentation is to help users understand how they can use and interact with your package, without having to read the source code. For the users of your code (including your future self), having readable and accessible documentation is invaluable. The reality is, if no one knows how to use your package, it will probably not get used. Documentation is not just a supplement to your packageâ€”it's an integral part of its usability, adoption, and long-term success. Investing time and effort into creating comprehensive, readable, and accessible documentation is essential for maximizing the impact and value of your package.

Importance of documentation:

- Accessibility: Documentation makes your package accessible to a wider audience by providing clear instructions and explanations on how to use it. This accessibility ensures that users, including yourself in the future, can understand and leverage the package's features effectively. Compile it into a user-friendly and shareable HTML format and host it online.

- User Adoption: Well-documented packages are more likely to be adopted and used by others. Users are more inclined to utilize packages that have comprehensive documentation, as it instills confidence in the package's reliability and usability.

- Ease of Onboarding: Documentation facilitates the onboarding process for new users or team members who are unfamiliar with your package. Clear explanations, tutorials, and examples help newcomers understand the package's purpose, functionality, and usage patterns quickly.

- Reduced Support Burden: Comprehensive documentation can significantly reduce the burden of providing support for your package. When users can find answers to their questions and troubleshoot issues independently through documentation, it minimizes the need for direct support requests.

- Enhanced Collaboration: Documentation fosters collaboration among team members by providing a common reference point for understanding the package's implementation details, API usage, and best practices. Consistent documentation standards also promote effective communication and knowledge sharing within the team.

- Maintainability and Extensibility: Well-documented code is easier to maintain and extend over time. Documentation serves as a roadmap for future development efforts, guiding maintainers on how to modify or extend existing functionality without introducing unintended side effects.

- Community Engagement: Documentation plays a crucial role in engaging with the wider community of users and contributors. Clear documentation encourages feedback, contributions, and discussions around the package, leading to its continuous improvement and evolution.

- Professionalism: High-quality documentation reflects positively on the professionalism and dedication of the package maintainers. It demonstrates a commitment to providing a positive user experience and adds credibility to the package within the developer community.
