This part of the project documentation focuses on an
**understanding-oriented** approach. You'll get a
chance to read about the background of the project,
as well as reasoning about how it was implemented.


# Context and background
When writing code, it is not only important making it work. Working 
in a team of professional software developers or on your own brings 
a plethora of challenges.

- Consistency in Coding Style: Different developers may have different coding styles, which can make the codebase inconsistent and harder to maintain. Solution: Establish coding standards and guidelines that all team members must follow. Tools like linters and code formatters can help enforce these standards automatically.

- Version Control: Without proper version control, it's difficult to track changes, merge contributions, and roll back to previous versions if needed. Solution: Use a version control system like Git, and establish workflows such as feature branching and pull requests for managing changes collaboratively.

- Communication: Effective communication is crucial for ensuring that everyone on the team understands the goals, requirements, and changes being made to the codebase. Solution: Use collaboration tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Discord for real-time communication, and establish regular meetings or stand-ups to discuss progress and challenges.

- Code Reviews: Conducting code reviews helps maintain code quality, identify bugs, and share knowledge among team members. However, they can be time-consuming if not managed properly. Solution: Define clear guidelines for code reviews, automate repetitive tasks using tools like linters and automated testing, and ensure that reviews are conducted promptly to avoid bottlenecks.

- Managing Dependencies: Dependencies between different parts of the codebase and external libraries/frameworks can introduce complexity and potential conflicts. Solution: Use dependency management tools like npm (for JavaScript), pip (for Python), or Maven (for Java) to manage dependencies declaratively and ensure consistent environments across team members.

- Documentation: Lack of documentation can lead to misunderstandings, wasted time, and difficulty onboarding new team members. Solution: Document code thoroughly, including comments within the code, README files, and wiki pages explaining architecture, design decisions, and usage instructions.

- Testing: Inconsistent testing practices and inadequate test coverage can result in unreliable software with hidden bugs. Solution: Adopt a test-driven development (TDD) approach where possible, automate testing using frameworks like JUnit (for Java), pytest (for Python), or Jest (for JavaScript), and strive for comprehensive test coverage across the codebase.

- Managing Technical Debt: Rushing to meet deadlines or taking shortcuts can accumulate technical debt, making the codebase harder to maintain and extend in the future. Solution: Prioritize refactoring and debt repayment as part of the development process, allocate time for addressing technical debt in each sprint, and involve stakeholders in decision-making regarding trade-offs between speed and quality.


# Why this template

This project comes from the need to have a template for pyhon-based 
projects with automatic CI and CD to build robust and maintainable projects.

There are different preferences or opinions abuot CI and CD frameworks.
For the purpose the realization of this project followed the tutorial 
in [python-project-johannes](https://github.com/johschmidt42/python-project-johannes)


- Consistency: A template project ensures that all team members start with a consistent foundation, including folder structure, configuration files, and basic code scaffolding. This consistency reduces confusion and makes it easier for developers to navigate the codebase.

- Best Practices: A template project can incorporate best practices and recommended tools for the specific technology stack or project type. This helps ensure that all team members follow established conventions and standards, leading to higher-quality code.

- Time Savings: Developers don't need to spend time setting up the project from scratch, configuring tools, or researching best practices. Instead, they can start working on the actual features or fixes immediately, which increases productivity and reduces onboarding time for new team members.

- Reduced Errors: With a template project, common setup tasks are automated, reducing the likelihood of configuration errors or missing dependencies. This minimizes troubleshooting time and prevents issues that arise from inconsistent development environments.

- Learning Opportunity: For junior developers or those new to the technology stack, a template project serves as an educational resource. By examining the project structure, configuration files, and code patterns, they can learn best practices and gain insights into how experienced developers approach similar projects.

- Flexibility: While providing a template project establishes a baseline, it's also important to allow flexibility for customization based on specific project requirements or team preferences. Developers should feel empowered to modify the template as needed to fit the unique needs of their project.


# How to work with it

- This template can be used to start with a new project

- Continuous Improvement: A template project can evolve over time as new tools, technologies, or best practices emerge. By regularly updating and refining the template, teams can ensure that it remains relevant and continues to provide value to developers.
