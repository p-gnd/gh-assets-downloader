# Branching strategy (GitHub Flow)

The GitHub flow is a branching strategy for managing and collaborating on code projects using the Git version control system and GitHub. It involves a single main branch, called the default (main) branch, which is used for production code, and multiple parallel branches for development work.

The flow typically works as follows:

- Developers create a new branch for each new feature or bugfix they are working on.
- They make changes to their local copy of the code and commit them to the branch.
- They push the branch to GitHub and create a pull request (PR) to merge the changes back into the master branch.
- Other team members review and test the changes in the PR.
- Once the changes are approved, the PR is merged into the master branch.

The GitHub flow allows for multiple developers to work on different features simultaneously without conflicts, and also enables easy code review and testing before changes are deployed to production.
